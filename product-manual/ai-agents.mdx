## What is an AI Agent?

Agents are a way to automate lead and account research for your sales team. You can use them to simply answer questions about people or companies, and can use them to automatically qualify leads and accounts based on their research.

There are a few ways of creating an agent:
- Research agents
- Qualification agents
- AI agents on settings page

Let's dive into each of these.

## Research agents

You can use AI agents to answer questions about a person or account. Then you can show in a few places:
- In the plays list
- In the composer
- On the people/account pages

### Displaying research in the plays list

You can add a research agent to the plays list by clicking on `Add AI Agent` in the top right corner of the plays list.

## Using AI Research Agents with Coach

After adding AI Research Agents to a Play, you can use them in Koala Coach. You can select the relevant research knowledge to write personalized emails, LinkedIn messages, and call scripts.

Additionally, you can view research content on people and account pages.

## Qualification agents

You can use a qualification agent to automatically qualify leads and accounts based on research. 

### Creating an agent

To create an agent you can use for qualification, select or create a new agent in the third step of the `Create New Play` flow:

To create an AI agent, you'll need to:

1. **Agent goal** - Define the purpose of your agent (required)
2. **Question/Prompt** - Ask the specific question you want answered (required)
3. **Research type** - Choose between "Companies" or "People" (required)
4. **Research individual people** - Option for people-focused research
5. **Response Type** - Select how the AI should format its answer
6. **Advanced Options** - Additional configuration settings

<Note>
For qualification agents, the **Response Type** is particularly important. Based on those you'll set up criteria for qualifying leads and accounts.
</Note>

<Tip>
It's highly recommended to use `Boolean`, `Number` or `Picklist` response types for qualification agents. This will make it easier to set up qualification criteria.
</Tip>

### Qualification criteria and response types

Take the following example:

![Qualification agent](/images/product-manual/ai-agents/criteria-set-up.png)

The agent named `Sales Contracts > $50k` has response type `Boolean`, which means that the agent will only return a `Yes` or `No` answer.

You can then set up a rule to qualify a lead or account based on that answer.

**Response types**

We currently support the following response types:

- **String**: A text response for open-ended answers
- **Number**: A numerical value without currency formatting
- **Currency**: A monetary amount with the appropriate currency symbol
- **Percent**: A percentage value
- **Boolean**: A Yes/No or True/False response
- **Date**: A calendar date
- **List**: Multiple items returned as a list
- **Picklist**: Selection from predefined options

Keep in mind that the response type will affect the criteria you can set up.

## Managing agents

You can manage your agents in the `Agents` section of the settings page.
