## What is an Intent Signal?

An Intent Signal is a moment in the customer journey that signifies buying intent. Koala reports on the raw data of every single visitor across every single account, which can be a lot of data to comb through. Intent Signals are "highlights" of this activity that are so important they (1) generate a real-time Slack Alert and (2) are highlighted on the profile page.

Intent Signals can be made from any action a vistor does:

- **page view** (e.g., /pricing viewed for 30+ seconds)
- **form fill** (e.g., /webinar-registration with a work email)
- **active session time threshold** (e.g., visitor crosses 10 minutes session time this month)
- **user trait change** (e.g., user goes from anonymous to known by submitting an email)
- **account trait change** (e.g., data starts flowing into a workspace)
- **custom event** (e.g., 'Invite User' event happens in your product)

## Getting started with Intent Signals

Though it may sound like a simple concept, figuring out what Intent Signals to set up is at the core of your company's GTM strategy. We find that getting a few folks together — someone representing Demand Gen / Growth and someone representing the Sales Development team — often yields the best results. Koala makes it easy to iterate on Intent Signals — both trying new ones and discarding the ones that don't work.

To help you on this journey, we have two guides.

### First Intent Signals
<a href="/docs/admin-guides/first-intent-signals">First Intent Signals</a> contains best practices around setting up the first set of signals from your marketing site — think "visited the pricing page" or "visited our technical docs about SSO." These are simpler to instrument and are a blind spot in most organizations.

### Advanced Intent Signals
<a href="/docs/admin-guides/advanced-intent-signals">Advanced Intent Signals</a> contains some of the more powerful Intent Signals you should consider, especially if you have a free trial, PLG motion, or Proof of Concept in your Sales cycle.
