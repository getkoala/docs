## What is an agent?

Agents are a way to automate your sales workflows. You can use them to simply answer questions about a profile or account, or to qualify leads and accounts.

There are a few ways of creating an agent:
- When setting up qualification in a play
- AI agents on settings
- Research agents

Let's dive into each of these.

## Qualification agents

You can use a qualification agent to automatically qualify leads and accounts based on research. 

### Creating an agent

To create an agent you can use for qualification, select or create a new agent in the third step of the `Create New Play` flow:

To create an AI agent, you'll need to:

1. **Agent goal** - Define the purpose of your agent (required)
2. **Question/Prompt** - Ask the specific question you want answered (required)
3. **Research type** - Choose between "Companies" or "People" (required)
4. **Research individual people** - Option for people-focused research
5. **Response Type** - Select how the AI should format its answer
6. **Advanced Options** - Additional configuration settings

For qualification agents, the **Response Type** is particularly important. Based on those you'll set up criteria for qualifying leads and accounts.

### Qualification criteria and response types

Take the following example:

![Qualification agent](/images/product-manual/koala-agents/criteria-set-up.png)

The agent named `Sales Contracts > $50k` has response type `Boolean`, which means that the agent will only return a `Yes` or `No` answer.

You can then set up a rule to qualify a lead or account based on that answer.
