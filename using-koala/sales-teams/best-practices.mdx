## Advanced Strategies

### Account Mapping

Use Koala data to understand the full buying committee:

1. **Technical Evaluator**: Visits docs, integration pages
2. **Economic Buyer**: Pricing, ROI calculator  
3. **Champion**: Multiple visits, shares content
4. **Executive Sponsor**: Brief visits to specific pages

### Competitive Intelligence

Monitor when prospects research competitors:

<Warning>
Never mention you know they visited a competitor. Instead, position your differentiators naturally.
</Warning>

**Do:** "Many teams evaluating [category] solutions tell us they love our [differentiator]..."

**Don't:** "I saw you were looking at [Competitor]..."

### Expansion Opportunities

For existing customers, watch for:

- New team members visiting docs
- Increased usage patterns
- Interest in advanced features
- Pricing page revisits
