## Picking the right plan

We recommend remaining on the Team plan as long as you can. Team is designed to be generous and scale for quite some time. Typically, we see customers upgrade to Business when one of the following occurs: 

- (1) their need for Accounts grows beyond ~5,000 - 10,000, at which point the Unlimited Accounts offered by Business tends to make it cheaper
- (2) they have a specific CRM automation they need
- (3) they prefer to do budgeting around a seats-based model

Though not hard-and-fast rules, we've designed the plans to roughly work as follows:

| Stage | Plan  |
| ----- | ----- |
| Seed | Free |
| Series A | Team |
| Series B | Team -> Business |
| Series C and beyond | Business |


## Accounts, licenses, and event volume
Koala is a hybrid of an efficiency tool for sales reps and a powerful data platform. To understand the total Koala bill, you'll need to understand three metrics:
- Accounts
- Licenses
- Event volume

We provide a deep-dive into each of the three metrics below.


### Accounts
An Account, is any individual company that is tracked in your CRM or has visited your website and identified in Koala.

Koala guides toward Free, Team, or Business plans based on the number of accounts you want to track: 

| Plan | Accounts Included | Accounts Packs |
| ---- | ------------------ | ------------------ |
| Free     | 250        | Not available |
| Team     | 1,000      | $25 / mo for 500 |
| Business | Unlimited        | No charge |


<Note>
While Koala collects all data automatically, you can exclude any account that is not valuable to you with <a href="https://app.getkoala.com/goto/settings/excluded-accounts">excluded account filters</a>. 
</Note>

<Note>
Koala does not charge based on individual website Visitors, only the Accounts they belong to. This means you shouldn't have to be worried about spikes in website usage in case you run a marketing campaign or see one time traffic increases.
</Note>

### Licenses

Like any CRM or other sales app, Koala charges for licenses. 

| Plan | Licenses Included | Extra Licenses  |
| ---- | ----------------- | ------------------ |
| Free | 3 (hard limit) | Not available | 
| Team | 3  | $15 per user per month |
| Business | 10 | $50 per user per month |

A license entitles a rep to do three things:

- full access to the Koala app
- subscribing to a personalized Koala Weekly email
- receiving @-mentions in Slack when your account is showing intent

### Event volume
<Note>
Unless you have very high web traffic, this metric doesn't come up until you get into an <a href="/admin-guides/advanced-instrumentation">advanced instrumentation</a>.
</Note>

Under the hood, Koala is a fully featured product analytics database. We offer competitive pricing with other best-in-class product analytics tools.

| Plan  | Events Included | Event Packs |
| ----- | --------------- | ---------- |
| Free  | 100k			  | Not available |
| Team  | 500k             | $45 / mo for 100k events |
| Business | 1M           | Volume discounts available |

You can estimate your event cost by adding the number of pageviews, identifies, and custom events in Google Analytics + your product analytics platform.  We offer powerful tools to help you optimize these events, so you only get charged for what you use.

## Calculating total cost

<Note>
If you already have a trial going, we can give very accurate quotes based on current usage! Just ping us: support@getkoala.com.
</Note>

Ultimately you'll want to answer four questions:

**1. How many licenses do I need?**

- Who at the company would benefit from real-time notifications about their accounts and Koala Weekly?
- Who at the company would benefit from visibility into what our customers and prospects are doing on our site?

**2. How many accounts do I need?**

- How many accounts are in Koala? (Find the gray number on your <a href="https://app.getkoala.com/goto/accounts">accounts page</a>.)
- Can I cut some of the less interesting ones using <a href="https://app.getkoala.com/goto/settings/excluded-accounts">excluded account filters</a>?

**3. How many events do I want to send?**

- If you plan to do the basic instrumentation only, you can likely get a good proxy from your Google Analytics.
- If you plan to do the <a href="/admin-guides/advanced-instrumentation">advanced instrumentation</a>, you will need to look at your product analytics tool to get the total number of identifies, custom events, and pageviews.

**4. Do I need CRM Automations?**

- Needed if you want to automate workflow for any triggers generated in Koala. Otherwise, not needed.
