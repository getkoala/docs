## Overview

Koala can integrate with [Calendly](https://calendly.com?ref=koala) to capture events coming from your embedded Calendly booking iframe.

With a small bit of code you can capture key events in Koala as visitors interact with Calendly.

## Setup

1. [Install the Koala snippet](/get-started/quick-start) on the site where you are also embedding the Calendly booking iframe.
2. Anywhere *after* the Koala snippet, within the `<body>` tag of your html add this code snippet:

```html
<script>
  function isCalendlyEvent(e) {
    return (
      e.origin === "https://calendly.com" &&
      e.data.event &&
      e.data.event.indexOf("calendly.") === 0
    );
  }

  const eventNames = {
    "calendly.profile_page_viewed": "Calendly Profile Page Viewed",
    "calendly.event_type_viewed": "Calendly Event Type Viewed",
    "calendly.date_and_time_selected": "Calendly Date and Time Selected",
    "calendly.event_scheduled": "Calendly Event Scheduled",
  };

  window.addEventListener("message", function (event) {
    if (isCalendlyEvent(event) && window.ko) {
      const eventName = eventNames[event.data.event] || event.data.event;

      if (eventName) {
        window.ko.track(eventName, event.data.payload);
      }
    }
  });
</script>
```

This will start capturing all events bubbled from the Calendly widget in Koala, prefixed with the name "Calendly" (e.g. "Calendly Event Scheduled" or "Calendly Date and Time Selected"). 

<Note>
  Calendly does not currently support passing any details about the booking to the parent window where Koala is installed, other than the event that a booking happened.
