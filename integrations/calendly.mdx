## Overview

Koala can integrate with [Calendly](https://calendly.com?ref=koala) to capture events coming from your embedded Calendly booking iframe.

## Automatic Setup

1. [Install the Koala snippet](/get-started/quick-start) on the site where you are also embedding the Calendly booking iframe.
2. Leave the Calendly plugin turned on (it's on by default). Koala will automatically detect and capture Calendly events!

Out of the box, Koala will capture the following events:

- Calendly Profile Page Viewed
- Calendly Event Type Viewed
- Calendly Date and Time Selected
- Calendly Event Scheduled

## Manual Setup

With a small bit of code you can capture key events in Koala as visitors interact with Calendly.

1. [Install the Koala snippet](/get-started/quick-start) on the site where you are also embedding the Calendly booking iframe.
2. Anywhere *after* the Koala snippet, within the `<body>` tag of your html add this code snippet:

```html
<script>
  function isCalendlyEvent(e) {
    return (
      e.origin === "https://calendly.com" &&
      e.data.event &&
      e.data.event.indexOf("calendly.") === 0
    );
  }

  const eventNames = {
    "calendly.profile_page_viewed": "Calendly Profile Page Viewed",
    "calendly.event_type_viewed": "Calendly Event Type Viewed",
    "calendly.date_and_time_selected": "Calendly Date and Time Selected",
    "calendly.event_scheduled": "Calendly Event Scheduled",
  };

  window.addEventListener("message", function (event) {
    if (isCalendlyEvent(event) && window.ko) {
      const eventName = eventNames[event.data.event] || event.data.event;

      if (eventName) {
        window.ko.track(eventName, event.data.payload);
      }
    }
  });
</script>
```

This will start capturing all events bubbled from the Calendly widget in Koala, prefixed with the name "Calendly" (e.g. "Calendly Event Scheduled" or "Calendly Date and Time Selected"). 

<Note>
  Calendly does not currently support passing any details about the booking to the parent window where Koala is installed, other than the event that a booking happened.
