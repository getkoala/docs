## Overview

[Drift](https://drift.com?ref=koala) is a conversational marketing platform that helps you connect with customers in real-time through chat.

## Automatic Setup

1. [Install the Koala snippet](/get-started/quick-start) on your site where Drift is installed.
2. Koala will automatically detect and capture events from Drift including:
   - Drift Email Captured
   - Drift Phone Captured
   - Drift Conversation Started
   - Drift Meeting Booked

Koala will also automatically identify users from Drift conversations.

## Turning off autotracking for Drift

If you don't want all Drift events captured, or need to control when it's turned on, you can disable autotracking for Drift in the [Koala settings](https://app.getkoala.com/goto/settings/install).
