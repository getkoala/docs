  "Segment is the easiest way to install Koala. If you've already got Segment
  running on your website, we recommend this approach. With Segment, you can
  instrument Koala easily without code."

<Note>
  Segment's Analytics 2.0 is required for this client-side destination.

### Step 1: Connect your source to the Koala destination

Navigate to **Connections > Destinations > Add Destination** in the Segment app.
Search for "Koala" and add it to a source.

### Step 2: Enter your destination settings

You'll need to enter your "Koala Slug" which is the same url slug you set up
when first creating your workspace on Koala. Navigate in the Koala app to
[Settings > General](https://app.getkoala.com/users/login) to find your
workspace slug.

### Step 3: Configure which events to send from Segment (Optional)

Once connected, you can configure how you want to send data to Koala. By
default, Segment will forward track events and identify events to Koala. We
recommend sticking with the defaults!
