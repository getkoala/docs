  Add to Slack
</button>

### Introduction

There are three ways that you can send messages from Koala to Slack.

- Automatic notifications for high-intent activities
- Share an account to a channel
- Subscribe to list updates

Each is discussed more in detail below.

### Automatic notifications for high-intent activities

If you'd like to receive automatic notifications when high-intent activities
happen, you can enable them to Slack. The easiest way to get started is in the
[Notifications tab](https://app.getkoala.com/users/login).

After you've set up your triggers, here's an example of the Slack Integration
setup. You can send via **direct message**, an **existing channel**, or a **new
channel you create inline**. Here's how you configure it:

On the other side, once the intent is triggered, you'll get a notification via
Direct Message:

Or into a public channel:

### Share an account to a channel

If you'd like to manually share an interesting account to start a discussion
with the team, you can easily share any account with any channel. Navigate to
any **account profile page** in Koala and find this on the right:

![Share Account 1](/images/share-account-1.png)

In the Slack channel, it will appear like this:

![Share Account 2](/images/share-account-2.png)

### Subscribe to list updates

If you'd like a more automated notification when people enter or exit a smart
list, you can subscribe to a feed that triggers whenever a contact or account
"matches" or "unmatches" a smart list definition.

![List Update Message](/images/list-update-message.png)

To set this up, follow these steps:

- To create a Smart List in Koala:
  - From the main navigation menu, select
    [Accounts](https://app.getkoala.com/users/login) to create a list of
    companies, or [Vistors](https://app.getkoala.com/users/login) to create a
    list of people
  - Define the filters for your list and "Save Smart List..."
- Navigate to your list's notifications via
  [Lists > [List Name] > Notifications](https://app.getkoala.com/users/login)
- Select **"Slack"** and configure the channel you'd like to send notifications
  to
- You're all set! Now whenever a new company or person enters your list, you'll
  get notified.
