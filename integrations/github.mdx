## Connecting your GitHub account
Connect your GitHub account to pull in issues and pull requests from your watched repositories.


1. Go to the [GitHub app page](https://app.getkoala.com/goto/apps/github) in Koala.
2. Click **Connect GitHub**.
3. Select the "Profile Identity Tracking" option that best suits your use case.

- Strict: only track users that can be associated with an email address, or a company.
- Track everyone: track all users, even if they can't be associated with an email address or company.

3. Add any number of repositories to watch.

- Add repositories by entering the full URL, or by searching for the repository name.

## Best practices
Here are some tips to get started:

- Start by mapping out all the repositories your company owns that are most relevant. That can give you insight from a bottoms up perspective from how a company is starting to research your product. We do a historical sync here up to 12mo, so it can also give you visibility into who's a few months into the research journey. Which we're finding to be a pretty effective play.
- Map out other OSS projects in your space that are complementary or related to your product.
- Track your competitor's repos to understand what else is being considered.


## Using GitHub data in the Koala App

You can use GitHub data in the Koala app to create lists, alerts, and more.

A new `Sources` filter will appear in the top left of your lists, allowing you to filter by GitHub.
