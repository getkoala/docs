# Installation
- You must have an active Koala account [Koala](https://app.getkoala.com) before proceeding. If you don't have a Koala account, [sign up for free](https://app.getkoala.com/signup).
- You must have an active G2 account [G2](https://www.g2.com) with the [Buyer Intent Subscription](https://sell.g2.com/g2-buyer-intent-data). If you have an existing account, you can talk with your account manager to enable it, or reach out at support@getkoala.com, and we will be happy to assist you.

Then, you can manage your G2 integration from the [G2 settings page](https://app.getkoala.com/goto/apps/g2).

# Reading from G2

Upon connecting your G2 account to Koala, we will start to sync the buyer intent and page views from G2 into Koala and transform them into events.

# Intent Signals

Create intent signals from G2 events by accessing the [Intent Signals settings](https://app.getkoala.com/goto/signals) page.

- Click on the upper right corner on `New Intent Signal`.
- Select the type of signal as `G2`.
- Configure the event matching rules.
- Give a name to your signal.

And you are good to go. You can use the signal for any notification, automation, or filter on Koala.
