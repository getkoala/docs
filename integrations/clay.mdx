description: Send data to Clay via webhooks from Koala's Actions and Auto Outbound frameworks
---

## Overview

Koala integrates with Clay through webhooks, allowing you to send data from both the Actions framework and Auto Outbound campaigns. This integration enables you to:

- Enrich your Clay tables with intent signals and visitor data
- Trigger enrichment workflows in Clay
- Trigger signal-based plays to be run in Clay

## Integration Methods

### 1. Actions Framework

You can use Koala's Actions framework to send data to Clay via webhook when intent signals happen. 

This is the simplest way to integrate.

For detailed setup instructions, see our [Actions](/automations/actions) guide. Actions should be configured to use the "Webhook" destination.

### 2. Auto Outbound

Clay can be used as a destination for Auto Outbound campaigns, allowing you to:

- Leverage Koala to do AI Research, ICP filtering, and Auto Prospecting
- Send qualified prospects to a Clay table for further workflow

For detailed setup instructions, see our [Auto Outbound with Clay](/automations/auto-outbound/clay) guide.

## Setup Instructions

### Via Actions or Auto Outbound

1. Create a new table in Clay using "Import Data from Webhook"
2. Copy the Webhook URL from Clay
3. Paste the URL into your Koala webhook configuration (either Actions or Auto Outbound)
4. Test the integration using the preview panel

## Data Structure

The webhook payload sent to Clay includes all of the data you see in Koala, including:

- Intent Signal 
    - Details about which intent signal triggered the webhook
- Account context
    - Intent summary
    - Firmographic enrichment
    - Account details from CRM
- Visitor context
    - Email
    - Name
    - Title
    - Contact details from CRM

As you set up the webhook, Koala gives you a way to preview the exact payload using historical production data.
