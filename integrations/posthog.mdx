## Overview

[PostHog](https://posthog.com?ref=koala) offers session replay functionality that helps you understand user behavior by watching recordings of their sessions.

## Automatic Setup

1. [Install the Koala snippet](/get-started/quick-start) on your site where PostHog is installed.
2. Koala will automatically detect and link with PostHog sessions, allowing you to:
   - Connect Koala events with PostHog recordings
   - View session replays directly from Koala
   - Sync user identification

## Turning off autotracking for PostHog

If you don't want PostHog integration enabled, or need to control when it's turned on, you can disable autotracking for PostHog in the [Koala settings](https://app.getkoala.com/goto/settings/install).
