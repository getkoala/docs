<Note>
  While Koala can be added to your website with Google Tag Manager (GTM), you

Google Tag Manager (GTM) is a simple solution for managing tags and JavaScript

You can easily add, remove and manage snippets without requiring a developer to
update code.

### Step 1: Navigate to the “Tags” section of your GTM account, and click “New” to create a new tag:
