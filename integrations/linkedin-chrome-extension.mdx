The Koala Chrome Extension makes it easy to track reactions and comments on any LinkedIn post.

1. Install the extension in your browser from the [Chrome Web Store](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/koala/ejgkoecoplficfiknpppeppjlendbnph)

2. Once installed, you'll see a Koala icon in the top right corner of your browser or in the extensions menu.

3. Clicking the icon while browsing LinkedIn will open the extension, prompting you to input a post URL to track.

4. The extension will automatically detect when you are on a LinkedIn post page to let you seamlessly track the people interacting with it.

5. Tracked posts can be synced to a list in Koala, allowing you to view all interactions on a post in one place.

- You can see the list of tracked posts on the [LinkedIn app page](https://app.getkoala.com/goto/apps/linkedin_xt) in Koala.

<Note>
Note: for the extension to work, you must be logged in to LinkedIn when you use it, and you must also be logged in to your Koala workspace.
