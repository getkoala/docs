[FullStory](https://fullstory.com?ref=koala) is a digital experience analytics platform that helps you understand user behavior through session replay and analytics.

## Automatic Setup

1. [Install the Koala snippet](/get-started/quick-start) on your site where FullStory is installed.
2. Koala will automatically detect and link with FullStory sessions, allowing you to:
   - Link to session replays directly from Koala
   - Track rage clicks

## Turning off autotracking for FullStory

If you don't want FullStory integration enabled, or need to control when it's turned on, you can disable autotracking for FullStory in the [Koala settings](https://app.getkoala.com/goto/settings/install).
