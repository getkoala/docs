---

1. to ensure that they are always up-to-speed on their prospects' interests and
2. to find net new logos to start working.

Believe it or not, there are many visitors on your marketing site website right
now that are not even on Sales' radar. This instrumentation closes that gap.

Typically the most important intent for Sales falls into four broad categories â€”
visitors on the marketing site, visitors reading the docs, visitors reading the
blog (or other content), and self-service customers using the app.

This checklist will walk you through setting up an SDK to do data collection for
each of these categories. The SDK only works client-side, but we've kept it very
light (**~25kb**), so it shouldn't have an outsized impact on app performance,
especially if you install the SDK lower in the page.

The most helpful thing you can do is to ensure that as much traffic is
deanonymized as possible. Implementation-wise, this means ensuring that as many
identify() calls are happening as possible. Koala's SDK does the heavy lifting
around session management and identity merging, so all of the context about the
session when it was anonymous will become attached to the known user as soon as
you identify them.

## Developer checklist

Koala's [developer checklist](https://app.getkoala.com/users/login) (available
in-app) is the easiest way to get set up.

### Website Configuration

You'll start by configuring your URLs for all of the places you'd like to
collect intent from. By default, we recommend instrumenting:

- your marketing site
- your blog
- your technical docs
- your app

### Implementation Checklist

Once you've set your desired configuration, Koala will provide you with an
implementation checklist, which tells you each step you'll need to complete. If
you're familiar with product analytics tracking, it should take no more than an
hour or two to get fully set up.

### Debugger

Finally, we have a realtime debugger available in the app, so you have a
feedback loop about what is currently being tracked. The debugger has controls
to pause, filter for certain events, and throttle the speed.
