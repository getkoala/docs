Koala collects data about what activity is happening on your site or app, and highlights the activity that indicates high intent. Koala collects this data via a pixel that typically is installed on your website. Most companies start by installing it on their marketing website, blog, and technical docs. 

Koala reports on the entire intent spectrum â€” from the first time someone comes to your marketing site, through a trial, POC, or product-led motion, and even after someone becomes a customer. This is done by installing Koala directly via our SDK or by connecting us to one of your analytics tools (e.g., Segment, Rudderstack, Heap, etc.). Koala also collects data via server-side integrations that can send data directly from your servers when client-side tracking doesn't work for your use case. 

Next, the entire GTM team can collaborate on defining intent signals (think of this as highlighting a particular page view, event, or form submit):

From there, these intent signals can be sent to Slack and are surfaced throughout the Koala app. This will ensure that your SDRs can prospect net new opportunities from all this buying intent happening on your marketing site, your AEs are always aware of what their prospects are doing (trust us when you see that magic pricing page visit from the executive buyer), and even CSMs are prepared to have that renewal upsell chat (or intervene if product usage isn't as expected).

There's a lot more under the hood (read on!), but this covers the basics of Koala!

## FAQ

<AccordionGroup>

<Accordion title="How does Koala know which companies are on my site?">
	Koala partners with Clearbit to power IP to company intelligence using the
	Clearbit Reveal product.

	If you are already a Clearbit Reveal customer, you can simply connect Koala to
	your Clearbit account using your Clearbit API key.

	If you don't yet use Clearbit Reveal, Koala helps to automatically provision a
	Clearbit that includes a generous credit of 10,000 Reveal calls / month and 
	250 Enrich calls / month, with pay-as-you-go plans if you need more.

	Manage your Clearbit integration from the
	[Clearbit settings page](app.getkoala.com/goto/apps/clearbit).
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="How does Koala know the geolocation of prospects?">
	Koala uses Cloudflare and the MaxMind GeoLite2 Database to provide IP-based geolocation to 
	give you a better idea of where your visitors are from. This is especially helpful when you 
	have an anonymous visitor from an account and can use the city/state/country and another tool
	like LinkedIn Sales Navigator to figure out who it is.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="How does Koala detect known users?">
	When users identify themselves on your website (ie., submit an email address), Koala
	will automatically observe that and associate their browser session with the user.
	This often happens when a user logs in or signs up, but it also happens whenever they
	submit a form (ie., demo request, gated content, webinar registration, etc.).

	Koala manages all of the tricky profile merging logic on your behalf.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Does Koala detect HubSpot forms automatically?">
	Koala automatically detects form inputs and ignores sensitive fields. If there are
	visitor or account traits you want to capture, you can manually instrument that via
	`ko.identify` though (client-side or server-side)!
