  "Koala provides several ways to identify or deanonymize your visitors. We'll
  discuss the two most common ways we deanonymize your visitors, and then answer
  some frequently asked questions about the topic."

### IP to Company matching

Koala partners with Clearbit to power IP to company intelligence using the
Clearbit Reveal product.

If you are already a Clearbit Reveal customer, you can simply connect Koala to
your Clearbit account using your Clearbit API key.

If you don't yet use Clearbit Reveal, you can provision a Clearbit key through
Koala that includes up to 10,000 Reveal calls per month and 2,500 Enrich calls
per month, with pay-as-you-go plans if you need more.

Manage your Clearbit integration from the
[Clearbit settings page](https://app.getkoala.com/goto/apps/clearbit).

### IP Geocoding

Koala also provides IP-based geolocation to give you a better idea of where your
visitors are from. This is especially helpful when you have an anonymous visitor
from an account and can use the city/state/country and another tool like Sales
Navigator to figure out who it is.

### First-party identification

When users do something identifiable in your app, like logging in or registering
an account, you can identify them manually. This enables you to:

- Track a visitor across browsers or devices
- Differentiate truly anonymous visitors from known users
- Combine all activity from a visitor before and after they've logged in
  Associate visitors with company data

The most effective way to do first-party identification is to instrument a
`ko.identify(email)` call using the [client-side SDK](/get-started/quick-start).

<Note>
  If you're using Segment, Koala will automatically detect and send `identify`
  calls from Segment's analytics.js library by default (unless you've explicitly
  disabled it).
</Note>

Koala also automatically collects non-sensitive form submissions, like your demo
request form, webinar registration, or content download forms. Our client-side
SDK combines several hueristics to collect email and other user traits from form
submissions.

## FAQ

<AccordionGroup>

<Accordion title="What if the same computer is used by more than one person?">
  Similar to other analytics tools, the same device and browser is considered to
  be the same visitor. When someone logs out, we recommend you call `ko.reset()`
  to reset the identify tied to that browser.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Does Koala pick up Hubspot forms?">
  Koala automatically detects form inputs and ignores sensitive fields. If there
  are visitor or account traits you want to capture, you can manually instrument
  that via `ko.identify` though (client-side or server-side)!
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Does Koala create anonymous profiles for people and then if you get more info about them attach that to all of that person's past behavior?">
  Yes! Koala automatically handles all of that identify merging logic.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="If someone fills out a form with an incorrect email, what happens?">
  If it is an anonymous session, Koala will associate that session with the
  email given in the form-fill. However, Koala prioritizes `ko.identify` calls,
  so if there is a login and accompanying `ko.identify` call, it will be
  overridden with the data from the login.
