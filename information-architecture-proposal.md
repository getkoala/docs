# Information Architecture Improvement Proposal for Koala Documentation

## Executive Summary

After analyzing the Koala documentation repository, I've identified several opportunities to improve the information architecture to enhance reader understanding and navigation. The current structure mixes different user personas, has overlapping content, and lacks a clear progressive disclosure pattern. This proposal outlines specific changes to create a more intuitive, user-centric documentation experience.

## Current State Analysis

### Strengths
- Clear separation of technical content (SDK, developer guides)
- Good use of Mintlify for documentation framework
- Comprehensive coverage of features and integrations

### Weaknesses
1. **Mixed User Personas**: Admin guides, developer guides, and seller guides are at the same navigation level
2. **Unclear Hierarchy**: "Sources" and "Integrations" have overlapping content
3. **Scattered Identity Content**: Identity-related content appears in multiple sections
4. **No Clear Learning Path**: Users must jump between sections to complete tasks
5. **Redundant Integration Documentation**: Same integrations appear in multiple places

## Proposed Information Architecture

### 1. Restructure by User Journey and Persona

Create a clear hierarchy that follows the user's journey from discovery to advanced usage:

### 2. Specific File Reorganization

#### Move and Consolidate Files:

1. **Merge Identity Content**:
   - Move `identity-layer/intro.mdx` â†’ `implementation-guide/identity/understanding-identity.mdx`
   - Move `identity-layer/identify-email-recipients.mdx` â†’ `implementation-guide/identity/email-recipients.mdx`
   - Move `developer-guides/sending-identify.mdx` â†’ `implementation-guide/identity/identifying-users.mdx`
   - Move `get-started/identifying-users.mdx` â†’ Merge into above

2. **Consolidate SDK Documentation**:
   - Create `implementation-guide/installation/` directory
   - Move all SDK files into appropriate subdirectories
   - Add overview page explaining different installation methods

3. **Reorganize Integrations**:
   - Create single `reference/integrations/` directory
   - Categorize by integration type (CRM, Analytics, etc.)
   - Remove duplicate entries from sources

4. **Create Role-Based Guides**:
   - Transform `rep-guides/` â†’ `using-koala/sales-teams/`
   - Split `admin-guides/` between `using-koala/admins/` and `implementation-guide/`
   - Move technical admin content to implementation guide

### 3. Content Improvements

#### A. Add Missing Overview Pages

Create new overview pages to provide context:

1. **Core Concepts** (`getting-started/core-concepts.mdx`):
   - Intent signals explained
   - Identity resolution
   - Data flow architecture
   - Key terminology

2. **Planning Your Implementation** (`implementation-guide/planning.mdx`):
   - Pre-requisites checklist
   - Decision tree for installation method
   - Timeline expectations
   - Team roles and responsibilities

3. **Integration Overview** (`implementation-guide/integrations/overview.mdx`):
   - When to use which integration
   - Data flow diagrams
   - Common integration patterns

#### B. Improve Navigation Flow

1. **Add "Next Steps" sections** to each page
2. **Create learning paths** for different roles
3. **Add prerequisites** to technical guides
4. **Include time estimates** for implementation tasks

### 4. Implement Progressive Disclosure

Reorganize content from simple to complex:

1. **Level 1: Conceptual** (Getting Started)
   - What and why
   - Basic concepts
   - Quick wins

2. **Level 2: Procedural** (Implementation Guide)
   - How to implement
   - Step-by-step guides
   - Common configurations

3. **Level 3: Advanced** (Reference)
   - API details
   - Edge cases
   - Customization

### 5. Improve Cross-References

1. **Create a taxonomy** of related topics
2. **Add "Related Articles"** sections
3. **Implement topic tags** for better discovery
4. **Build a comprehensive glossary**

## Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Structure (Week 1)
1. Create new directory structure
2. Move files to new locations
3. Update mint.json navigation
4. Set up redirects for old URLs

### Phase 2: Content Creation (Week 2-3)
1. Write missing overview pages
2. Add navigation helpers (next steps, prerequisites)
3. Create role-based landing pages
4. Develop learning paths

### Phase 3: Enhancement (Week 4)
1. Add cross-references
2. Implement search improvements
3. Create visual diagrams
4. Add interactive elements

### Phase 4: Validation (Week 5)
1. User testing with each persona
2. Fix broken links
3. Gather feedback
4. Iterate on structure

## Success Metrics

1. **Reduced time to first value** (measure quick start completion)
2. **Decreased support tickets** about basic setup
3. **Improved search effectiveness** (click-through rates)
4. **Higher documentation satisfaction scores**
5. **Increased completion rates** for implementation guides

## Conclusion

This restructuring will create a more intuitive, user-centric documentation experience that guides readers through their journey with Koala. By organizing content around user needs rather than product features, we can significantly improve comprehension and reduce the cognitive load on readers.

The proposed changes maintain all existing content while making it more discoverable and actionable. The phased implementation approach ensures minimal disruption while allowing for iterative improvements based on user feedback.
