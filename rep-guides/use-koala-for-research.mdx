### Start with the 'macro' — spend a few minutes situating yourself on what the company does, the industry, and try to understand what a potential use case would be.

Use the **Company** tab to quickly learn about the company. If you already know about the company, feel free to skip this! If you don't know much about the company, you should be able to answer a bunch of questions:
1. Is this a tiny startup, a growth-stage company or a giant enterprise? 
2. What industry are they in? (e.g., should I be pitching them on our Financial Services use cases and other Fin Serv logos?)
3. Do they have a relevant tech stack? (e.g., if we need them to be using Kubernetes, do they have it installed?)
4. What do they do? (there will be a few sentences provided and if you can't figure it out, you can always click on the domain to learn more!)

Look for **recent intent signals**. It's much easier to sell to an account when you are top-of-mind. By understanding who has done which intent signals recently and what those intent signals were, you can often tailor your messaging to make it much more relevant. Our guide on <a href="/rep-guides/sending-great-sales-messages">send great sales messages</a> has more on how to think about crafting a sales message.

### Once you have a macro plan, zoom in on the 'micro' — use the granular visitor detail to make a plan of attack.

First, understand all **known visitors**. The visitors tab will give you a sense of how every visitor is engaging — if you're lucky, you'll get some visitors who have logged in and you'll be able to see exactly who they are.  Look them up or enrich them to get their titles and try to understand what access to power you already have vs. what access to power you'll need.
<Note>
  If you consistently run into profiles with a lot of anonymous visitors, you may want to ask sales leadership to read our guide on <a href="/docs/admin-guides/how-to-drive-more-known-users">driving more known users</a>. Koala has many ways to get more known visitors!

Next, understand your **anonymous visitors**. While it's a little more work to do this, you can combine their geographical location and the account name to try to figure out who they might be. While it's not perfect, often plugging this into a tool like Sales Navigator will help you make an educated guess as to who was on the site.

Once you have a relatively complete picture, make a plan of attack — if you have access to power already, you probably want to engage with them. If you only have end-users, that's okay too — figure out how to make them a champion by solving one of their problems and use this to get access to power.
