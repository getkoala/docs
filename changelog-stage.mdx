Welcome to Day 4️⃣ of Koala Launch Week 🐨🚀🗓️ — our final day! The careful observer will note that we promised launches every day this week but didn't launch on Monday, so today is double-launch!

## 👉 Introducing Scaled Self-service

As a company helping folks with their own PLG motion, we want to walk the walk. Today, we're announcing that we're ready for **Scaled Self-service** (we've always been self-serve, but now we have the playbook required to help Rev Ops teams scale to teams of 100+ reps on their own). Skip the $100k contract and 3-6 month implementation cycle. Get it done in just hours. Seriously. (We're still happy to help of course!)

Get started here: https://getkoala.com/docs/get-started/what-is-koala

## 👉 Introducing the Koala Platform

We've had two-way CRM integrations with Hubspot and Salesforce since day one, but we wanted to announce four new integrations:

- **Deanonymize traffic.** With the brand-new Powered by Clearbit program, Clearbit is offering 10k free Clearbit Reveal calls per month to Koala customers!
- **Get visibility into your technical docs.** New ReadMe & Mintlify integrations. Get notified when someone is reading about enterprise features, like your SOC2 report or SSO RBAC controls.
- **Create outreach tasks.** Scaled workflow to ensure reps follow up on every great intent signal.

## Thank you, customers!

Finally, we'd be remiss to end Launch Week without a huge thank you to our customers. We've learned so much from your daily product ideas, bug reports, and pushes to be simpler.

We're excited to announce 100+ daily active customers, including many of the most elite go-to-market teams in the world.
