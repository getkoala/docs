Auto Outbound works out of the box with Outreach Sequences. You can choose to enroll every prospect
into the same Sequence, or choose to map each individual Intent Signal to a specific Outreach Sequence.

## Recommended Setup
The recommended setup for Outreach includes mapping each Intent Signal to an individual Outreach Sequences, as that leads to higher
conversion rates due to higher relevancy in messaging.

### Mapping Intent to Sequences
Select the Intent Signal from the dropdown on the left, and map it to the relevant Sequence in Outreach
on the right.

We recommend naming your Sequences after the Intent Signal in Koala using the following naming convention:
`[Koala] <Intent Signal Name>`

<Note>
Following the above naming convention allows you to more easily track the performance of your Auto Outbound campaigns,
as well as indicates that sales reps shouldn't manually add prospects to these Sequences.
</Note>

### Multi enrollment and Prospect creation
Koala will automatically manage Prospect creation in Outreach in cases where a record does not exist already.

The Auto Outbound engine will also prevent that the same Prospect is enrolled in multiple Sequences at the same time.
