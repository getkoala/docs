Auto Outbound allows you to sync your eligible prospects into Salesforce (Salesforce Sales Cloud) campaigns, as well as importing 
the qualifying Intent Signal into a Contact, Lead, Account, or Custom Object.

## Recommended Setup
The recommended setup for Auto Outbound in Salesforce includes two steps: Updating any recordsÂ about the Prospect, and enrolling
them into a Campaign.

You can choose to do both, or only tag specific fields in an object.

### Enrolling the prospect in a Campaign
Similar to other Auto Outbound destinations, the Salesforce destination allows you to map specific Intent Signals to
specific Campaigns in Salesforce. This allows you keep track of the performance of individual signals, as well as give
you more control on how you want to activate Intent Data in your CRM.

### Importing Contact and Lead Records
The Salesforce destination allows you to tag the Intent Signal performed by the prospect directly
in a Lead or Contact record in Salesforce.

Koala will look up the Contact or Lead by email, and then update the record or create a new one with the fields
you choose to map between Koala and Salesforce.

We recommend that you map all Intent Signal fields to custom fields in your Salesforce object.
This mapping should enable you to reference the most recent Intent Signal performed by the prospect.

### Importing Account Records
Similarly to Contact importing, you can choose to automatically map Intent Signal fields into an Account.
You can follow the same steps as above, to update or create a new Account when a new Prospect is eligible for Auto Outbound.
