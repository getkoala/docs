Auto Outbound works out of the box with Apollo Sequences and Lists. You can choose to enroll every prospect
into the same Sequence or List, or choose to map each individual Intent Signal to a specific Apollo Sequence.

## Recommended Setup
The recommended setup for Apollo includes mapping each Intent Signal to an individual Sequence, as that leads to higher
conversion rates due to higher relevancy in messaging.

### Mapping Intent to Sequences
Select the Intent Signal from the dropdown on the left, and map it to the relevant Sequence in Apollo
on the right.

We recommend naming your Sequences after the Intent Signal in Koala using the following naming convention:
`[Koala] <Intent Signal Name>`

<Note>
Following the above naming convention allows you to more easily track the performance of your Auto Outbound campaigns,
as well as indicates that sales reps shouldn't manually add prospects to these Sequences.

### Adding Prospect to Lists
You can optionally choose to add the Prospect into an Account or Contact List in Apollo, which allows you trigger
different Plays based on the Prospect being part of a list.

Using lists should also allow for the same Prospect to be part of multiple lists depending on the Intent Signals they
performed.
