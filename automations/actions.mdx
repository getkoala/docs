## What are Actions

Koala's Actions engine allows you to create custom workflows that are triggered by intent signals.

You can use these workflows to update your CRM, Sales Engagement Platform such as Outreach and Apollo,
or sync data into third party tools.

## What can you do with Actions?
The primary use case for Actions is triggering a third party tool in response to an intent signal.

Some examples of workflows include:

### Automatically importing Contacts and Companies

You can import net new Companies and Contacts to your Salesforce, Hubspot, Outreach, and Apollo, making sure 
that your CRM is always up with the visitors and companies browsing your website.

In addition to importing new Companies and Contacts, you can also update existing records with new information as 
it becomes available in the Koala Companies Database.

### Syncing intent data into your CRM
A common use case for Actions is syncing intent data into your CRM.

This can include updating a Contact or Company record with intent signals are they take place.

Advanced use cases include creating a new Intent Signals object that is related to a Contact or Company record in your CRM, which allow you
to architect your CRM to be aware of the intent signals that are being detected by Koala.


### Enriching your CRM with firmographic data
Similar to syncing intent data into your CRM, you can also enrich your CRM with firmographic data from Koala, such as industry, employee count, revenue, tech stack
and many other fields.

### Tracking prospects and companies in lists, campaigns, or sequences
You can add prospects and companies to lists, campaigns, or sequences in your CRM, and Sales Engagement Platform when they exhibit intent signals.

Examples include mapping intent signals to a Campaign in Salesforce, a list in Apollo or Hubspot.

### Creating Tasks based on intent signals
Create new tasks in your CRM or Sales Engagement Platform when intent signals are detected, so your sales team can follow up with prospects and companies that are showing intent.

### Triggering external workflows
You can also trigger an external workflow in an external tool, such as Zapier, Clay, Tray.io or any other tool that accepts webhooks.

Some of the most creative use cases for Actions involve triggering a workflow in a third party tool such as enriching a table with intent in Clay, or
triggering complex workflows in Tray.io.
