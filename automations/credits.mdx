description: "Understand how Automation Credits are counted."
---

The Koala Automations product is available on all plans.
The Business and Pro plans include unlimited action credits, while the other plans include
limited credits.


## Understanding Credits
Each succesfull Automation run deducts 1 credit from your available credit pool.

There are separate pools for Actions, Auto Outbound and Slack Alerts, so you can try
all three products individually on your own time.

Credits are deducted when any succesfull Automation is run. 

## Credit Limits

- Slack credits are counted per month, and reset on the first day of your subscription start date.
- Action and Auto Outbound credits are counted per workspace, and do not reset.
- There's no limit on the number of Automations you can create, only on the number of times they can run.

The following table shows the credit limits for each plan:

| Plan | Action Credits | Auto Outbound Credits | Slack Alert Credits |
--- | --- | --- | ---
| Free | 100 | 10 | 250 alerts /mo |
| Starter | 100 | 10 | Unlimited |
| Team | 100 | 10 | Unlimited |
| Pro | Unlimited | Unlimited | Unlimited |
| Business | Unlimited | Unlimited | Unlimited |

## What happens when I run out of credits?

When you run out of credits, your Automations will not run until you have more credits available.
You can upgrade your plan to get more credits, or wait until the next month for Slack credits to reset.
