## What is Auto Outbound?

Auto Outbound automatically enroll a prospect into a highly relevant Sequence when they show intent, and message them at the right time.

Koala's Auto Outbound engine offers a variety of customization options that allow you to target the right
prospects with the right message without interferring with existing deals, customers, or highjacking any existing conversations.

## Why use Auto Outbound?

Auto Outbound is a powerful tool that can help you reach the right Prospect with the right message at the right time, leading to higher reply rates and more opportunities.
Our customers have seen a significant increase in reply rates when using Auto Outbound, as well as 2x~5x more opportunities created.

They achieve this by:
- Mapping Website and Product usage data to Intent signals
- Targeting the highest Fit prospects based on their Ideal Customer Profile
- Using highly relevant messages that are tailored to the prospect's intent
- Reliably tracking the performance of their Auto Outbound campaigns, and iterating on targeting and messaging

Koala helps you with all of the above.

- [Intent Signals](/docs/intent/intro) allow you to map your website and product usage to signals you Sales Team understands.
- [Content Reports](/docs/intent/content-reports) help you track the conversion rate of each Intent Signal, and understand which Signals and Content drives most pipeline.
- [Fit Scoring](/docs/fit/intro) allows you to define and score your Ideal Customer Profile based on firmographic and technographic data.
- Auto Outbound allows you to map individual Intent Signals to Sequences, and send highly relevant messages based on Intent.
- The Auto Outbound engine keeps all the receipts for every action it takes, and helps you understand who qualifies for your Auto Outbound campaigns, and who doesn't.

# Creating an Auto Outbound Campaign
Head over to the [Auto Outbound](https://app.getkoala.com/goto/auto-outbound) page in the Koala App to get started.

## Getting Started
You can create multiple campaigns and target different segments of your prospects based on their Intent and Fit.

### 1. Give your Auto Outbound Campaign a name
Give it a name that you can easily recognize, and that describes the purpose of the campaign.

### 2. Define the Eligible Audience
The next step to using Auto Outbound is to define who's eligible for your Auto Outbound campaign.

We recommend using firmographic filters such as `# of Employees`, `Estimated Revenue`, or `Industry` to target the right prospects for your business.
Customers on our Pro and Business plan can also use Koala firmographic Fit Scores to target the highest Fit prospects. We recommend targeting `A` and `B`
Fit Accounts.

For Visitors, we recommend checking the `Work Emails` option to screen out folks who have no intention of buying your product.

<Note>
Koala will automatically calculate the size of the audience that matches your criteria, and show you how many prospects are eligible for your Auto Outbound campaign in real time as you update your filters.
You can also use the `Preview` button to see a list of prospects that match your criteria.
</Note>

### 3. Handle Existing Customers
The next step is to define how Koala should handle existing customers and conversations.
You likely want to ignore any customer who's already in a conversation with your team, or has already purchased your product.

Our recommended presets work out of the box for most standard HubSpot and Salesforce setups,
but you can also customize the rules to fit your specific use case using Advanced Filters.

### 4. Define the enrollment criteria
Now that you have defined the audience for your Auto Outbound campaign, it's time to define the enrollment criteria.

The criteria for your campaign should be based on the Intent Signals you're tracking in Koala, how often you want to enroll a Prospect.

<Note>
You can also choose to set an artificial delay to your Auto Outbound campaign,
to ensure that the prospect has enough time to engage with your product before you reach out to them.
</Note>

### 5. Select a Sender
You can optionally select a specific user to send the Auto Outbound emails from.
This helps you maintain your threads going when a prospect replies to your Auto Outbound email.

We recommend that you pick the sales rep who owns the account, or the territory owner for your audience.

You can choose from one of the presets available, or roll your own advanced Routing with the `Advanced Filters` option.

### 6. Select your Sequences
