Before diving into implementation, it's important to understand the core concepts that power Koala. This guide will introduce you to the key terminology and concepts you'll encounter throughout the documentation.

## Intent Signals

Intent signals are the foundation of Koala. They represent specific actions or behaviors that indicate a prospect or customer's interest in your product.

### Types of Intent Signals

## Identity Resolution

Koala's identity resolution system connects anonymous website visitors to known contacts in your CRM.

### How It Works

    A[Anonymous Visitor] --> B{Email Provided?}
    B -->|Yes| C[Known User]
    B -->|No| D[IP Lookup]
    D --> E[Company Match]
    C --> F[Complete Profile]
    E --> F
```

### Identity Sources

1. **Direct Identification**: When users log in, sign up, or submit forms
2. **Analytics Integration**: Pulling identified users from Segment, Mixpanel, etc.
3. **CRM Sync**: Matching with existing contacts in Salesforce, HubSpot
4. **IP Intelligence**: Using Clearbit Reveal for company-level identification
