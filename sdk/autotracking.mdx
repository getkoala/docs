# What is autotracking?

By default, Koala will _automatically track_ certain events on your website. This includes:

- pageviews
- form submissions
- active session time
- presence (when a user is active on your site vs idle)

This means that you don't need to write any code to track these events. Koala will automatically track them for you. Whether you have a single page app or a traditional website.

## Disabling autotracking

You can disable autotracking entirely by setting the `autocapture` option to `false` when you initialize the Koala pixel.

When loading from the CDN/script tag, add this before your script:

```javascript
window.koalaSettings = {
  sdk_settings: {
    autocapture: false,
  },
};
```

When using the NPM package, add this to your initialization:

```javascript
import * as KoalaSDK from "@getkoala/browser";

let ko = null;

// returns a promise containing the ko namespace object
KoalaSDK.load({
  // add your project's public key here
  project: "pk_...",
  sdk_settings: {
    autocapture: false,
  },
}).then((koalaSDK) => {
  ko = koalaSDK;
});
```

This will fully disable all autotracking of pageviews, form submissions, active session time, and presence.

## Manually/programmatically enabling or disabling autotracking at runtime

You may want to enable or disable autotracking temporarily on some pages, for instance, if you are using Koala in a SPA that navigates seamlessly across your marketing site and product dashboard.

You can do this by calling `ko.startAutocapture()` and `ko.stopAutocapture()`.

```javascript
// start autocapture
ko.startAutocapture();
// now,
// pageviews will automatically be tracked (including the current page immediately)
// form submissions will be tracked
// active session time will be tracked
// presence will be tracked
```

```javascript
// stop autocapture
ko.stopAutocapture();
// now,
// pageviews will not be automatically tracked
// form submissions will not be tracked
// active session time will not be tracked
// presence will not be tracked
```
