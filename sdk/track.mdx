```

Include additional context about the event:

```js
ko.track('Signed Up', {
  plan: 'Team Plan',
  frequency: 'monthly',
  source: 'Pricing Page'
})
```

### Demo Request

Track demo requests with qualification data:

```js
ko.track('Requested Demo', {
  team_size: '10-50',
  how_did_you_hear_about_us: 'Google Search',
  use_case: 'Lead Generation'
})
```

### Feature Usage

Track specific feature interactions:

```js
ko.track('Created Dashboard', {
  dashboard_type: 'Sales',
  widgets_added: 3,
  template_used: 'Default'
})
```

### Purchase Events

Track revenue-generating events:

```js
ko.track('Subscription Upgraded', {
  from_plan: 'Starter',
  to_plan: 'Pro',
  value: 99.00,
  currency: 'USD'
})

## Integration with Segment

If you're using Segment, Koala can automatically hook into your existing Segment events:

```js
// Your existing Segment code
analytics.track('Signed Up', {
  plan: 'Team Plan',
  source: 'Pricing Page'
})

// Koala will automatically receive this event
// No additional ko.track() call needed
```

<Note>
  Contact your Koala team to enable Segment integration and automatic event forwarding.

## Use Cases

### Intent Signals
Use custom events to define [Intent Signals](/product-manual/intent-signals) that trigger when prospects show buying intent:

```js
ko.track('Viewed Pricing', {
  plan_interest: 'Enterprise',
  pricing_page_time: 45
})
```

### Slack Alerts
Send real-time [Slack Alerts](/product-manual/slack-alerts) when important events occur:

```js
ko.track('High Value Signup', {
  company_size: '500+',
  plan: 'Enterprise',
  source: 'Product Hunt'
})
```

### Sales Qualification
Track events that help qualify prospects:

```js
ko.track('Integration Connected', {
  integration_type: 'Salesforce',
  setup_completed: true,
  team_size: '50+'
})
```

## Best Practices

<Tip>
  **Use descriptive event names**: Choose names that clearly describe the action, like "Requested Demo" instead of "Button Click".
</Tip>

<Tip>
  **Include relevant context**: Add properties that help you understand the event better and create more targeted intent signals.
</Tip>

<Tip>
  **Be consistent**: Use the same event names and property structures across your application.
</Tip>

<Warning>
  **Avoid PII in properties**: Don't include sensitive personal information in event properties.
</Warning>

```js
ko.track('Requested Demo', {
  team_size: '10-50',
  how_did_you_hear_about_us: 'Google Search'
})
```
