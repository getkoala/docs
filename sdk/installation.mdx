## Troubleshooting

### Using a strict Content Security Policy

Koala asynchronously loads different parts of the library as needed. If your site uses a strict Content Security Policy (CSP) that specifies which locations can download JavaScript or use Websockets, then you'll need to update the CSP to handle those pieces used for Koala.

<Note>
  You may see client-side errors about a "Content Security Policy" directive if
  you are using a strict CSP and Koala has not be added to it.
</Note>

Depending on your CSP configuration, you may need various CSP directives like `connect-src` or `script-src` to allow Koala to work properly.

If you have a strict `connect-src`, add these endpoints to it:

- `https://*.getkoala.com`
- `wss://*.getkoala.com`

If you have a strict `script-src`, add this endpoint to it:

- `https://*.getkoala.com`

If you have a strict `script-src-elem`, add this endpoint to it:

- `https://*.getkoala.com`

It's likely you can find it in your codebase if you do a case-insensitive search for `script-src`, but if you need to learn more about it, use this resource to learn more: https://content-security-policy.com

### Installing the library under a custom global namespace

When you load Koala through snippet code, by default, the SDK installs on window.ko global variable. If this causes a conflict with another library or code on your site, you can change the global variable used by Koala.

Change the global variable in the beginning of your snippet code as shown below. In this case, Koala uses window.custom_key to load instead of window.ko.

```diff
  - !function(){var k="ko", ...
  + !function(){var k="custom_key", ...
```

Alternatively, you can use the `window.globalKoalaKey` to set the global variable.

```html
<script>
  // Koala will use this global key instead of window.ko, in this case window.custom_key
  window.globalKoalaKey = "custom_key";
</script>

<script>
  // paste your Koala snippet here
</script>
```
