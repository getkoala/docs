## Troubleshooting

### Using a strict Content Security Policy

Koala asynchronously loads different parts of the library as needed. If your site uses a strict Content Security Policy (CSP) that specifies which locations can download JavaScript or use Websockets, then you'll need to update the CSP to handle those pieces used for Koala. 

<Note>
You may see client-side errors about a "Content Security Policy" directive if you are using a strict CSP and Koala has not be added to it.
</Note>

Depending on your CSP configuration, you may need various CSP directives like `connect-src` or `script-src` to allow Koala to work properly.

If you have a strict `connect-src`, add these endpoints to it:
- `https://*.getkoala.com`
- `wss://*.getkoala.com`

If you have a strict `script-src`, add this endpoint to it:
- `https://*.getkoala.com`

It's likely you can find it in your codebase if you do a case-insensitive search for `script-src`, but if you need to learn more about it, use this resource to learn more: https://content-security-policy.com
