description: "This guide helps ensure your email recipients will be identified in Koala"
---

Koala is able to detect when a user clicks a link to your website from an outbound or marketing email.
You can use this feature to collect identities from any clicks to your outreach messages.

This integration often leads to a boost of 20~30% net new identities to your Koala workspace, allowing you to
understand how your email prospects are interacting with your content and product.

Koala will also report all UTMs that drove the user to interact with your website from an email.

## Outreach.io

Koala offers an out of the box solution that allows you to track any clicks automatically. All links will be wrapped with a special param that is able to identify
your users when they click any links from an Outreach message that points to your website.

You can install the [Koala Outreach Plugin](https://marketplace.outreach.io/apps/koala-id-links?store=unlisted) in the Outreach Marketplace. All links in your email will be automatically decorated with a `utm_id`.

## HubSpot

## Koala Email Params

You can tag any outbound links on any platform using the Koala Email param. All you need to is add ko_e or utm_id to any URL you'd like to be tracked when a prospect clicks it:


1. Start with an email address

```
tido@getkoala.com
```

2. Choose one of two flavors:

- a) A simple `ko_e` email param:

If there are no other URL params
```
?ko_e=email@example.com&k_is=dir
```

If there are other URL params
```
&ko_e=email@example.com&k_is=dir
```

- b) Or use `utm_id` with a base64 email parameter:
```javascript
let binary = Buffer.from(email);
let base64Encoded = binary.toString("base64");
```

3. Construct your URL:
```
https://getkoala.com/docs?ko_e=netto@getkoala.com
```

or if using option b

```
https://getkoala.com/docs?utm_id=${base64Encoded}
```

*Note: Option b is recommended for use cases where you're generating your URLs with a programing environment where you can base64 emails into IDs*
